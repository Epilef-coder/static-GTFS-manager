I'm using this fork of the orginal source
https://github.com/zoopit/leaflet-geoman

because there is 1 performance issue that i've encountered:
With large polyline, the edito performance is very slow this was fixed. (https://github.com/geoman-io/leaflet-geoman/pull/484)
And the fork allows merge multiple layers.
